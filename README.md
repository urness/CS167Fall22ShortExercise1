# CS167 Fall 22 Short Exercise #1 (part 2)

This is Part 2 of Short Exercise #1, where I am asking that you get familiar with both Google Colab and GitHub Classroom. Once you have the assignment starter code up in Google Colab, you just need to follow along using the starter code and the assignment (CS167_SE1_HelloWorld.pdf).

## Exercises :muscle: 
1. Print out Hello World
2. Insert a Text cell and play around with markdown
3. Build a quick function and test it
